# ðŸ“¥ Installation & Usage

You are going to need to have the latest version of [node js](https://nodejs.org/en) installed. Recommended to run on a VPS for 24/7 Uptime!

Open `config.js` in `src/settings/config.js` and fill it out, I documented everything, if you need help setting up the bot you can contact me [here](https://koma4k.xyz/)!

Open `emoji.js` in `src/settings/emoji.js` and input all the emojis for the bot!

Once both files are filled out, open command prompt and cd to the bots directory then run `npm i` or `npm install` to install all the necessary packages. Once all the packages are done installing run `npm start` or `node .`, your bot should now be online and ready to start playing music! Enjoy!
